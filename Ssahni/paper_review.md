# introduction Section
% I Will read abstract at the last

## Comment
1. The introduction should state the problem / objective more explicitly. It is clear that you aim to fill a gap in the literature with your research on the sintering behavior of Fe35Ni nanopowders, but the significance of this study is not clearly stated. Why is it important to understand this process? Who will benefit from it, and how? Answers to these questions will provide a more solid justification for your study.

2. While you provide an extensive literature review on sintering studies conducted on other materials, it would be helpful to provide more background on Fe-Ni alloys and their specific behaviors or properties that make them unique or interesting to study in the context of sintering.

3. Explicitly state the unique contributions of your work. It's good to state how your work differs from the previous studies mentioned.

4. The phrase "MD is a powerful method to investigate the physical [11,12], mechanical [13–15] and sintering phenomena [16–19] for different materials" might be clarified with the use of "properties" after "physical" and "mechanical" for better understanding.

5. Make sure that all the abbreviations you use are explained upon first use. (I saw abstract the abbreiviations but I think abstract can have abbreviated form!)

6. In the context of MD simulation, mentioning specific methods or models you will use (like EAM) would add clarity.


## Typo and Grammar Correction

1. "Fe-Ni Invar alloys are known for their lowest thermal expansion coefficient value..." should be "Fe-Ni Invar alloys are known for having the lowest thermal expansion coefficient value..."

2. "...and have widely used in precision instruments..." should be "...and have been widely used in precision instruments..."

3. "Hu et al.[18] analysis of the melting and sintering process of silver (Ag) nanoparticles..." should be "Hu et al.[18] analyzed the melting and sintering process of silver (Ag) nanoparticles..."

4. The phrase "Similarly, Nandy et al. [22] perform the MD simulation..." should be in the past tense, like "Similarly, Nandy et al. [22] performed the MD simulation..."

5. Replace "As these alloys of varying composition exhibit a variety of properties" with "These alloys, with their varying compositions, exhibit a wide range of properties".

6. Replace "However, their tendency to coarsen during the processing of powders or materials makes it difficult for them to maintain nanostructures" with "However, the tendency of these materials to coarsen during powder or material processing complicates the maintenance of their nanostructures".

7. Replace "Nanoparticles have much higher surface curvature and surface energy than bulk particles, which helps the sintering process and makes the process different from that of micro /millimeter particles." with "Nanoparticles, having a much higher surface curvature and surface energy than bulk particles, facilitate the sintering process, distinguishing it from that involving micro/millimeter particles".
