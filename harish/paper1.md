# Comment for Section 1 : Introduction
1. *Historical Context and Gap in the Literature*: It would be beneficial to include a brief historical context on the development of molybdenum alloys and powder metallurgy techniques. Additionally, it is essential to explicitly state the existing gaps in the literature. For example, you mentioned that the liquid phase sintering of Mo alloys using Ni-Cu binder is studied less, but it would be more incisive to indicate specific questions or issues that remain unanswered in previous research.

2. *Elaborate on the Significance*: Though you mentioned the significance of molybdenum and its alloys in various industries, it would be helpful to elaborate more on the potential implications of optimizing the Ni-Cu ratio in binders for these applications. This could include how this optimization could potentially revolutionize certain industries, or open up new avenues for application.

3. *Sentence Structure and Grammar*: 

   a. There is a missing space before the word "Also" in "costly [7]Also".
   
   b. There is a missing space before "Previous research" in "temperatures [4]Previous research".
   
   c. Add a comma after “temperatures” and “interface” for improved clarity.
   
   d. Instead of "the sintering kinetics of molybdenum are enhanced", it would be more grammatically correct to say "the sintering kinetics of molybdenum is enhanced".
   
   e. The term "thermo-mechanical treatment" might be better expressed in its abbreviated form, TMT, after the first usage.
   
   f. The last sentence "When Ni-Cu binary binder is used in activated sintering of Mo, then there is formation of a brittleMo-Ni phase at the solid-liquid interface lowering the ductility of these alloys [9]." could be made clearer by rephrasing to "When a Ni-Cu binary binder is used in the activated sintering of Mo, a brittle Mo-Ni phase forms at the solid-liquid interface, which lowers the ductility of these alloys [9]."

5. *Objective and Scope*: Clearly stating the objective of the study in a separate paragraph can be beneficial. Furthermore, it might be worthwhile to mention the scope of the study, as in whether if it is an investigation without a specific focus or you are focusing on certain applications or industries.

# Comment for Section 2 : Methods and Materials

1. The term "effective sintering time*" has an asterisk but doesn't seem to have a corresponding footnote explaining why it is different from the sintering time. A brief explanation or a footnote would enhance clarity.

2. You mentioned that the green samples were sintered under a controlled atmosphere using high-purity hydrogen gas. Was it 100% pure Hydrogen. Better write commercially pure hydrogen

3. More information on how the cylindrical sintered compacts were sectioned (e.g., using what type of equipment), as well as details on the mounting and polishing procedures (e.g., the grit size of the polishing paper, the type of mounting resin) would add rigor to the methodology.

4. Additional elaboration on the parameters chosen for the stereological quantification, why they are significant?

5. Provide a citation or reference for the open-source image analysis software, ImageJ, that you have utilized for the stereological quantification.

### Grammatical Refinement

1. In the sentence “The nomenclature, composition and effective sintering time* of these alloys are provided in Table 2.”, it would be grammatically correct to change “are” to “is” since the phrase “nomenclature, composition and effective sintering time” is taken collectively as information provided in Table 2.

# Comment for Section 3.1 and 3.2 : Result and Discussion

1. In the Densification Response section, you talk about the role of Ni and Cu in the densification of the alloys, but the initial role of Mo in the densification process isn't discussed.

2. The section states that alloys A4 and A5 experience a loss of structural rigidity due to distortion but does not provide a detailed explanation or discuss the possible causes of distortion. I would suggest adding a subsection under the “Densification response” section, elaborating on the factors contributing to the distortion observed in alloys A4 and A5. Explaining why A4 and A5 experience distortion while others do not, in relation to their compositions and processing conditions, could be very informative.

3. When you refer to various figures, it might be beneficial to add a brief description of what the reader should focus on. For example, in "As Mo has negligible solubility in Cu, as can be seen from Figure 5(b), A1 does not undergo LPS," it would be helpful to guide the reader on what they should observe in Figure 5(b).

4. Clarifying Terminology: In the sentence "Upon replacing one-fourth of Cu with Ni due to Mo’s solubility in Ni (as seen from Figure 5(a)), LPS occurs...” - it would be clearer if you specify that you are discussing the substitution of copper with nickel in the alloy composition.

5. In section 3.2.4, the discussion about connectivity should be connected more directly to the effects on structural rigidity and densification. The linkage between the structural characteristics and the densification behavior can be made more explicit.

6. Consistency in Subsection Numbering: There is a discrepancy in the subsection numbering. The subsection "3.2.4 Connectivity" is repeated twice for different topics. The second occurrence should be "3.2.5 Contiguity" instead.


7. In the Microstructure Evolution section, you explain the formation of the intermetallic compound at the Mo particle-matrix interface, but a more detailed explanation on why this compound is forming only at this interface could be useful. What properties make Mo more susceptible to the formation of an intermetallic compound?

8. In the Stereological Quantification section, you give detailed and well-explained stereological measurements, but you could also clarify the purpose of these measurements for your study. Why are these the relevant measures to take and how do they contribute to your overall findings?

### Grammatical Refinement

1. "All alloys are sintered to near-net shape, except A4 and A5, where there is a loss of structural rigidity due to distortion" - This sentence is a bit confusing. Consider revising it to: "All alloys, except for A4 and A5, are sintered to near-net shape. A4 and A5 exhibited a loss of structural rigidity due to distortion".

2. "As the Ni-Cu ratio increases, densification further increases, while A4 and A5 show a slight decrease in sintered density compared to A3." - For clarity and consistency, consider changing it to: "As the Ni-Cu ratio increases, densification further increases. However, A4 and A5 show a slight decrease in sintered density compared to A3.". 

3. "The average Mo particle size increases with increasing the Ni:Cu ratio (up to 75:25) and then decreases, as shown in Figure 7(f)." - This could be clearer as: "As the Ni:Cu ratio increases up to 75:25, the average Mo particle size also increases. Beyond this ratio, however, the particle size decreases, as shown in Figure 7(f)."

4. "On increasing the Ni-Cu ratio, i.e. (alloy A2 to alloy A5), liquid phase sintering takes place." - Better as: "With an increase in the Ni-Cu ratio (from alloy A2 to alloy A5), liquid phase sintering occurs."

5. "Contrary to this, we observe that the Mo grains are becoming irregular in shape on increasing the Ni-Cu ratio as shown in Figure 7(a-e)." - Consider revising to: "Contrary to expectations, we observe that Mo grains become irregular in shape as the Ni-Cu ratio increases, as shown in Figure 7(a-e)."

6. There are numerous instances where "i.e." is used where "e.g." would be.

7.  In the sentence "The microstructures of alloys A1-A5 are shown in Figure 7(a-e), resembling the typical microstructure of 90W-10(Ni-Cu) alloys featuring Mo particles embedded into a continuous matrix." It is better to use "embedded in" instead of "embedded into".

8. In the sentence "On carefully observing the BSE images at high magnifications, we find that the matrix of alloy and alloy A2 is homogeneous...", it appears that you might have missed mentioning one of the alloys before "and alloy A2".

9. It's advisable to maintain consistency in number representation. For example, use "Figure" consistently instead of switching between "Figure" and "Fig.".

# Comment for Section 3.3 : Result and Discussion

1.  In the "Thermodynamic study" section, you have detailed the process, but a discussion on how the results correlate with or deviate from your EDS and XRD findings would be insightful.

2.  It might be beneficial to occasionally link the results back to what was stated in the introduction or hypothesis, which gives context to the significance of the findings.

3.  In section 3.3.1, after presenting the EDS results, it may be fruitful to provide more insight into what these results imply regarding the properties and performance of the alloys. Perhaps discussing the implications of the phase homogeneity or lack thereof on the mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, or other relevant aspects would be enlightening.

4.  Title for Table 3: There is a discrepancy in numbering, as “Table 3” is mentioned twice. It is necessary to revise the numbering for coherence and clear referencing.

5.  There appears to be an inconsistency in figure numbering and referencing. For instance, in the section "3.3.2 XRD Analysis," the XRD patterns are stated to be shown in Figure 18, however, the context indicates that this should be Figure 19. It is advisable to ensure that all figures are correctly numbered and referenced throughout the manuscript.

6.  Acronyms such as BSE (Back Scattered Electrons) should be explicitly defined at their first mention.

7. In the "3.3 Phase evolution" section, an interpretation of how the elemental composition changes in different alloys could be more elaborative. Discussing the mechanisms or factors leading to these changes would augment the manuscript's depth.

8.  In the "3.4 Thermodynamic study" section, a more detailed explanation of the Liquid Miscibility Gap (LMG) would be beneficial. A brief overview of its significance in the context of your research could add value to the reader's understanding.

9.  It seems the section "3.4 Mechanism of liquid phase sintering in 90Mo-10(Ni-Cu) alloys" has been truncated and lacks completion. Please ensure that all the steps in the mechanism are included, and the section is concluded appropriately.

10.   Provide a citation or reference for the THEMOCALC software

11.   Alloy A4: It would be helpful if you could provide the exact composition for the Cu-rich matrix for Alloy A4 as you have done for the other alloys. This is currently missing in Table 3.

12. Some explanation about the THEA v3.3 database and the THEMOCALC software would be helpful for readers unfamiliar with these tools.

13. It would be pertinent to compare your findings with existing literature. For instance, how does the phase evolution in your alloys compare to what has been previously observed or theorized? Are there any deviations, and if so, how can they be explained?

14. 


### Grammatical Refinement

1. In section 3.3.2, change "The XRD patterns of all the alloys is shown" to "The XRD patterns of all the alloys are shown".

2. For consistency, use either “wt.%” or “wt%” throughout the text. The current text uses both forms interchangeably.

3. "The Mo particles have a BCC crystal structure, and Cu-rich and Ni-rich matrix phases have an FCC crystal structure." - Reword for clarity: "The Mo particles possess a BCC crystal structure, while both Cu-rich and Ni-rich matrix phases exhibit an FCC crystal structure."

4. "The intermetallic compound also forms when Mo-(1.5-3wt%)Ni alloys were solid state sintered at 1300°C for 1 hour in a hydrogen atmosphere [17]." - Maintain tense consistency: "The intermetallic compound also formed when Mo-(1.5-3wt%)Ni alloys were solid-state sintered at 1300°C for 1 hour in a hydrogen atmosphere [17]."

5. "To our knowledge Mo-Ni-Cu is the first system which employs LPS in the presence of two liquid phases, having different solubilities of base metal." - Add a comma for better readability: "To our knowledge, Mo-Ni-Cu is the first system which employs LPS in the presence of two liquid phases, having different solubilities of base metal."

6. "This is evident from Figure 8(a-b), where we can see that the MoNi intermetallic compound is only found at the interfaces between Mo grain and Ni-rich solid solution, as shown in Figure 8." - You repeated the reference to Figure 8. Consider revising to: "This is evident from Figure 8(a-b), which shows that the MoNi intermetallic compound is only found at the interfaces between Mo grain and Ni-rich solid solution."

7. "During heating of the compacted powders (green compact), when the first liquid forms, it will wet the Mo grains and helps in the rearrangement step, as shown in Figure ." - Maintain tense consistency and correct syntax: "During the heating of compacted powders (green compact), when the first liquid forms, it wets the Mo grains and helps in the rearrangement step, as shown in Figure ." (Infact rewrite it, First liqid? drop compacted powders, use only green compact)

8. "As can be seen from the BSE micrographs, the amount of Ni-rich matrix phase increases with the Ni-Cu ratio." can be rephrased to "The BSE micrographs illustrate an increase in the amount of the Ni-rich matrix phase as the Ni-Cu ratio increases."


# Summary and conclunsion

Liquid phase sintering in the Mo-Ni-Cu ternary system transpires either in the presence of a single liquid phase or dual liquid phases, contingent upon the Ni content. Alloys with a higher proportion of Cu (alloys A1 and A2) undergo sintering in the presence of a Cu-rich liquid phase. However, the densification process is somewhat languid due to the minimal solubility of Mo in the Cu-rich liquid. Conversely, alloys with a preponderance of Ni (alloys A3 and A4) experience sintering involving both Cu-rich and Ni-rich liquid phases. The Ni-rich liquid phase plays a pivotal role in accentuating densification owing to its elevated solubility for Mo.

Stereological analyses divulge that alloys with a high content of Ni (alloys A3 and A4) exhibit larger grain sizes coupled with high Mo solubility. Furthermore, these alloys manifest low dihedral angles and low interconnectivity, which contribute to the loss of structural cohesiveness and lead to geometric distortion. Prolonged sintering durations facilitate the formation of the MoNi intermetallic compound at the interfaces between Mo particles and the Ni-rich liquid. This stable intermetallic compound acts as a barrier to solution-reprecipitation reactions and impairs further grain growth and Mo particle rounding, as corroborated by stereological analyses.

Based on the insights gleaned from this investigation, a putative mechanism for liquid phase sintering in the Mo-Ni-Cu system involving dual liquid phases is posited. Given the salience of sintering time and temperature in determining the attributes of liquid phase sintered alloys, a supplementary study is slated to examine the employment of homologous sintering temperatures to achieve uniform superheat across all compositions. Moreover, the optimization of sintering duration will be explored to elucidate the conditions conducive to the synthesis of 90Mo-10(Ni-Cu) alloys devoid of intermetallic compounds.

# Abstract

Molybdenum, a refractory material, boasts an elevated melting point of 2610°C and is predominantly synthesized through powder metallurgy, albeit at exigent temperatures reaching 1800°C. This study scrutinizes the liquid phase sintering of molybdenum with varying proportions of Ni-Cu binders, aiming to attenuate the sintering temperature while enhancing kinetics. Employing the manufacturing design paradigm for 90W-10(Ni-Cu) tungsten heavy alloys (WHAs) and utilizing conventional powder metallurgy techniques, Mo-based 90Mo-10(Ni-Cu) alloys were synthesized.

Initial findings indicate that densification of Mo-compacts escalates with increasing Ni:Cu ratio in the binder phase, albeit with marginal decrement past a threshold. Notably, an overabundance of Ni precipitates structural enfeeblement and geometric distortion during sintering. Through meticulous microstructural analysis, stereological parameters, encompassing grain size, circularity, and volume fraction, were quantified. Intriguingly, in contrast to 90W-10(Ni-Cu) WHAs, 90Mo-10(Ni-Cu) alloys with a Ni-rich composition manifested irregular Mo grains, a heterogeneous matrix, and Mo-Ni intermetallic compound formation.

Thermodynamic analyses were executed employing Thermo-Calc software, generating isothermal sections of Mo-Ni-Cu ternary phase diagrams at discrete temperatures to elucidate the heterogeneous matrix and intermetallic compound formation. In Ni-rich alloys, two distinct liquid phases – Ni-rich and Cu-rich – emerge at sintering temperatures. These phases, exhibiting disparate solubilities for molybdenum, solidify into a heterogeneous matrix. Moreover, the presence of a Ni-rich liquid phase coupled with extended sintering durations culminates in the formation of MoNi intermetallic compounds. Both micro-hardness and bulk hardness escalated with increasing Ni:Cu ratios in the binder phase.

These revelations provide the groundwork for postulating a putative mechanism for liquid phase sintering in the Mo-Ni-Cu system when two liquid phases are present.
