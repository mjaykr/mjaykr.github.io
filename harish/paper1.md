# Comment for Section 1 : Introduction
1. *Historical Context and Gap in the Literature*: It would be beneficial to include a brief historical context on the development of molybdenum alloys and powder metallurgy techniques. Additionally, it is essential to explicitly state the existing gaps in the literature. For example, you mentioned that the liquid phase sintering of Mo alloys using Ni-Cu binder is studied less, but it would be more incisive to indicate specific questions or issues that remain unanswered in previous research.

2. *Elaborate on the Significance*: Though you mentioned the significance of molybdenum and its alloys in various industries, it would be helpful to elaborate more on the potential implications of optimizing the Ni-Cu ratio in binders for these applications. This could include how this optimization could potentially revolutionize certain industries, or open up new avenues for application.

3. *Sentence Structure and Grammar*: 

   a. There is a missing space before the word "Also" in "costly [7]Also".
   b. There is a missing space before "Previous research" in "temperatures [4]Previous research".
   c. Add a comma after “temperatures” and “interface” for improved clarity.
   d. Instead of "the sintering kinetics of molybdenum are enhanced", it would be more grammatically correct to say "the sintering kinetics of molybdenum is enhanced".
   e. The term "thermo-mechanical treatment" might be better expressed in its abbreviated form, TMT, after the first usage.
   f. The last sentence "When Ni-Cu binary binder is used in activated sintering of Mo, then there is formation of a brittleMo-Ni phase at the solid-liquid interface lowering the ductility of these alloys [9]." could be made clearer by rephrasing to "When a Ni-Cu binary binder is used in the activated sintering of Mo, a brittle Mo-Ni phase forms at the solid-liquid interface, which lowers the ductility of these alloys [9]."

4. *Objective and Scope*: Clearly stating the objective of the study in a separate paragraph can be beneficial. Furthermore, it might be worthwhile to mention the scope of the study, as in whether if it is an investigation without a specific focus or you are focusing on certain applications or industries.
